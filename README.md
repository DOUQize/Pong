# Pong
Game pong
This is my first Ping Pong game.
Written in the arcade python library.
Textures are attached to the game: 5 digits and a racket with a ball,
the textures of the racket and ball must be in the same folder as the starting file,
the numbers must be in the numbers folder, which must be in the same folder as the starting file.
